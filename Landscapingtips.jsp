            <ul>
                <li>When it comes to how often a lawn should be mowed, the focus should be on the length of the grass blades and not on any specific timeline. This is because if grass is cut too short, it can put stress on the lawn and weaken it.</li>
                <li>The amount of sun and water a lawn has gotten can determine how fast grass grows in a given time period. The faster that grass grows, the more often it needs to be cut.</li>
                <li>To cut through some of the confusion, a good rule to consistently follow is the One-Third Rule. According to this rule, one must never cut blades of grass more than one-third of their height. This typically times out to mowing every 1-2 weeks during spring and fall months and every week during summer months, but it is still very much subjective. There could also be some variations with different grass types.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Some people like perfectly manicured hedges and others just trim them right before they start to look unwieldy. It is a matter of your preference.  This yard service is only needed a couple of times per year.</li>
                <li>The frequency at which you need to trim hedges depends on the hedge type. It also depends on the age of the hedge.</li>

            <h3 class="media-heading">Watering Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Water a lawn only when it needs it. Overwatering can lead to higher water bills, weed growth, extra mowing, and fertilizer runoff.</li>
                <li>Instead of watering every day, only water a couple of times a week depending on the need.</li>
                <li>The water should go about 6-8 inches deep into the soil.</li>
                <li>Watering in the morning is best to reduce the amount of evaporation that can lead to water waste.</li>
                <li>Make sure sprinklers are not wasting water by watering the driveway or sidewalk.</li>
