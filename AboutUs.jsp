                        Welcome to Green Thumb Lawn Service, your number one source for all your lawn care needs. We're dedicated to 
                        giving you the very best of lawn supplies and services, with a focus on the customer, reliability and 
                        sustainability.

                        Founded in 2019 by Jay, Kristina and Michelle, Green Thumb Lawn Service was started as a school project striving
                        to provide quality lawn care services and products through an easy to use online store. When we first started 
                        out, our passion for coding and desire to increase efficiencies and provide quality service to customers drove
                        us to create the GTLS system and gave us the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to an innovative
                        online store. We now serve customers all over Maryland, and are thrilled to be a part of the eco-friendly wing
                        of the lawn service industry.
                        
                        Green Thumbs is a company dedicated to producing a quality lawn care service system that allows users to 
                        easily order supplies and products and enables companies to process requests quickly and efficiently.
                        We strive to eliminate the middle man and put you in charge of your business' online presence while helping 
                        the customer to have an enjoyable shopping experience.
                        
                        Green Thumbs is made up of three University of Maryland University College students and we are here to serve 
                        your lawn care needs with our eCommerce lawn service.
